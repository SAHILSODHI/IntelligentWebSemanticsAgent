ENGL,802,Professional Development Workshops ," The Department holds a series of workshops with the aim of introducing doctoral candidates to pertinent research, teaching, and professional expectations and enhancing career development. In order to graduate, all doctoral candidates must attend these workshops before the end of the sixth term. Master's students are also strongly encouraged to attend the relevant sessions since they are a constitutive component of graduate formation. If a student has attended a given workshop during his/her master's degree, he/she is exempted from that workshop.
 Workshops are led by faculty members and organized by the Graduate Program Director on a monthly basis in anticipation both of key dates during the PhD program (e.g. external grant application due dates) and the future professional life of the doctoral candidate (e.g. academic job interviews). The course is graded on a pass/fail basis.",http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fofa.html
ENGL,890,Thesis Proposal,Students are admitted to candidacy for the PhD upon acceptance by their advisory committee of the written thesis proposal and its successful defence.

ENGL,891,The Major Field Examination I ,"This course focuses broadly on the candidate’s primary area of specialization, covering major authors, genres, and issues and the pertinent canonical texts therein, in order to consolidate the necessary background knowledge for advanced literary research and teaching at the university level. In the examination, candidates are expected to demonstrate comprehensive knowledge of the designated field as well as an original, critical understanding of the field and its constitutive texts. The Department has established reading lists in nine broad areas of specialization that cover a variety of periods, nations, and subjects. These basic lists may be modified to suit the interests of individual candidates. A substitution of 20 per cent is permitted for all reading lists for the purposes of tailoring the lists to the interests of the student.  Such substitutions are to be determined by agreement between the student and the student's supervisor and are subject to approval by the Graduate Program Committee.",http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fofa.html
ENGL,892,The Sub-Field Examination II ," This course is designed to cultivate a more specific area of inquiry that may include a body of literary texts in combination with readings in a particular set of methodological or theoretical problems to the end of developing a viable doctoral topic and composing a thesis proposal. The Sub-Field Examination list is established by the candidate in consultation with the doctoral supervisor and comprises approximately 60 items that are seen as directly relevant to the field in which the dissertation is oriented. It is divided into three sections: 1) approximately 20 literary texts; 2) approximately 20 theoretical/methodological texts; 3) approximately 20 texts drawn from adjacent and/or ancillary fields. By “text,” it means the number of poems or articles deemed by field specialists as sufficiently representative of an author's work or period. A text cannot appear twice on any of the lists, including that of the Major Field. The lists and texts are not exhaustive, but are meant to provide the student with the necessary initiation to sub-fields that help to clarify the direction and goals of the dissertation. ",http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fofa.html

This course is graded on a pass/fail basis.,https://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/encs/engineering-courses.html

INSE,7100,Design and Analysis of Security Protocols,"Prerequisite: COEN 6311 or equivalent.
 The primary objective of this course is to present the methods used in the design and analysis of modern security protocols, introduction to existing cryptographic protocols. The most important security proprieties (such as authentication, secrecy, integrity, availability, atomicity, certified delivery and other properties), flaw taxonomy (such as freshness attacks, type attacks, parallel session attacks, implementation dependent attacks, binding attacks, encapsulation attacks and other forms of attack). Cryptographic protocol specification (general-purpose formal languages, logical languages, operational languages and security calculi). Cryptographic protocol analysis (security logics analysis, model-based and algebraic analysis, process algebra analysis, type based analysis). Limitations of formal methods and ad-hoc techniques, project will be offered in analyzing a number of published cryptographic protocols. The focus of this course will be on the design and the analysis of security protocols. A project is required.",https://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/encs/engineering-courses.html

INSE,7110,Value Added Service Engineering in Next Generation Networks,"Prerequisite: ELEC 6861 or equivalent.
 Telecommunications service engineering, or more simply service engineering, is the discipline that addresses the technologies and engineering process for the specification, implementation, testing, deployment, usage of value added services in telecommunication networks, value added services, or more simply services, can be defined as anything that goes beyond two party voice calls. They are either call related (e.g. call diversion, multiparty gaming, conducted conferences) or non-call related (e.g. customized stock quotes, web surfing from a cellular phone). Some services may combine call related and non-call related features (e.g. call centres). This course will cover the basics of service engineering (such as basic concepts, value added services, service life cycle, service engineering, intelligent networks, WAP/Imode/TINE-C). The basics of next generation networks (such as session initiation protocol (SIP), H.323, Megaco, H.248, 3GPP/3GPP2 architecture, softswitch). Signaling protocol-specific approaches (such as H.232 supplementary services, SIP CGI, SIP servlet API). Signaling protocol neutral approaches (such as CPL, JAIN JCC/JCAT, PARLAY; web services). Approaches at the research stage (such as context awareness; mobile code-based approaches). A project is required.",https://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/encs/engineering-courses.html
