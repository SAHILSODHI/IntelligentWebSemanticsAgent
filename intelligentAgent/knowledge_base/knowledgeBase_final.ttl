This course offers a panorama of Ireland’s vibrant contemporary theatre landscape. It puts the exciting experimental developments of recent years under the spotlight, engaging with Irish drama that blurs the line between reality and fiction, that immerses its audiences in morally challenging worlds, and that pushes the boundaries of theatre as a medium. From the collectively devised works of Charabanc to Verbatim plays about the Northern Irish troubles, from activist theatre to street theatre, this course explores what happens when theatremakers step outside of conventional spaces and working methods to make art for our mediatized, technologized and globalized era.""" ;

It begins with an introduction to the theory and methods of environmental and natural resource economics and concepts of sustainable development. Then the emphasis is shifted to the optimal use of natural resources, both non-renewable resources (mineral and energy) and renewable resources, and the valuation of environmental resources.

The thesis proposal should describe the topic of the thesis, situate it in the relevant literature, and discuss the intended research methods. The written version of the proposal is approved by the members of the thesis committee and followed by an oral defense before the committee members. Following this, the PhD candidate is invited to present his thesis proposal in a departmental seminar.",

The thesis proposal consists of a 40 to 60 page document outlining the object of study of the thesis, its objectives, the research hypothesis and the methodology that will be used or developed. A detailed bibliography will accompany the document as well as a preliminary table of contents. The thesis proposal must be defended orally before a jury consisting of the student’s supervisor and two faculty members.",

The written proposal will include a sound rationale for the proposed research, a detailed description of the research design and methodology, and a comprehensive literature review. Students are also required to present an oral presentation of their proposal to the Department. The thesis proposal must be formally approved by the thesis committee and the Graduate Program Director before research activities can begin. The thesis proposal should be completed before the end of the second semester of residency in the Program and after a minimum of 6 credits in the Program have been taken.",

The congeries of experimental movements collectively identified as Modernism, flourishing from prior to World War I until World War II, renegotiated artistic conventions, revived neglected traditions, and turned attention to the primary materials of art (sound, colour, language). In painting emerged a tendency to abstraction, in music a tendency to atonality, and in literature to non-mimetic forms. Experiments abounded in disjunctive, elliptical, impressionistic, allusive, and mythopoeic styles. Avant-garde artists organized into numerous schools, including the Imagists, Surrealists, Dadaists, Constructivists, Futurists, and Vorticists. The literature, often produced by expatriates, was cosmopolitan, elitist, and provocative. Much of the most important work, appropriately enough in an era of female enfranchisement, was written by women. It was also the “Jazz Age,” the nexus of which was the Harlem Renaissance. While the course focuses on the lively cross-fertilization of British and American writing, the international scope of Modernism is also emphasized, as well as its diversity (e.g. in ballet, cinema, music, and painting).""" ;

 This course considers one of the most serious problems facing our global civilization: the on-going conflict between economic activity and the bio-physical world upon which all human activity ultimately depends. The course explains the basic theoretical framework most economists use to describe economic activities and the relationship between these activities and the natural world. Understanding the logical apparatus of economics theory shows why market forces and environmental integrity are often in conflict and why economic arguments dominate environmental policy debates at both national and international levels.\r

It covers all aspects of the marketing management process. This course is designed to help develop the necessary skills to analyze market opportunities, research and select target markets, design effective marketing strategies, plan marketing programs, and organize, implement and control the marketing effort. The specificities of the marketing of services and their implications in terms of marketing strategies are emphasized.",
        """Prerequisite: MBA 641 previously or concurrently.\r
 This course focuses on the strategic role of marketing for firms by cultivating marketing management perspectives and skills. Attention is directed toward demonstrating how a manager can use information in micro and macro environments to develop marketing strategies for consumer value creation that integrate product, pricing, promotion, and distribution in order to obtain and maintain a sustainable competitive advantage. Both online and offline aspects of marketing strategies are incorporated to reflect the current environment. Through the use of lectures, case discussions and application-oriented readings, the requisite mindset is nurtured to facilitate marketing excellence in today's multi-faceted and dynamic business environment.\r

Topics covered include the organization of the river network, precipitation over a watershed, runoff, flood frequency analysis, estimation of peak streamflows, flow, and sediment transport in rivers. Assignments provide experience in the practical aspects of hydrological data treatment using Canadian examples. The course aims at understanding the mechanics of processes governing the motion of water on hillslopes and in rivers, which are essential to water management. Lectures and tutorial.""",

 In this course, the basic concepts of classical (equilibrium) thermodynamics are first reviewed, followed by an introduction to statistical thermodynamics which gives a unified method of treating transport processes.

Other important thermodynamic functions such as the partition function, the partition function for large ensembles and the Sackur-Tetrode equation are examined. The course also addresses non-equilibrium thermodynamics in the linear domain. The relations describing the production of entropy in irreversible processes due to heat transfer, charge transfer, change of volume, and chemical reactions are examined. The establishment of flux equations and the use of the Onsager reciprocal relations are then applied to the description of a variety of open systems. Lectures only.""" ;

The course includes theory, applications of the technique to the study of protein structure and function, and basic practice experiments to become familiar with the instrument and data analysis. For some of the techniques covered hands-on use will be limited. Each student is required to carry out a project on his/her own protein of interest. Each participant asks a specific question about a protein and then uses the techniques covered in the course to address the question. Lectures and laboratory.\r
