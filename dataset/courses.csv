"
DART,600,Design Theory/Practice I," This seminar develops a framework of practice-based and theoretical approaches that build the foundation of contemporary critical design practice and study. Drawing on examples and readings from a range of disciplines, students will explore design as a product, a practice, and a mode of social communication and investigate the cultural and discursive context in which design resides. The course will integrate the three program streams, namely visual communication, the built environment, and interaction design, and address the theme of sustainability as a timely concern for design practice."
DART,601,Research Methods in Design," This course introduces students to a range of methodologies and strategies used to conduct research in design. Students will be exposed to the relationship that exists between research as a practice-based activity and research as theory-based inquiry and will have the opportunity to engage in the research process through studio work, writing, and presentations."
DART,610,Design Theory/Practice II,"Prerequisites: DART 600 and DART 601.
 Through a combination of studio work, seminar discussions, workshops, and individual writings, students situate their work in different contexts, such as commercial, public, or domestic environments, and explore new venues for dissemination. Such investigations enhance students’ ability to contextualize, articulate, and exhibit the thesis work."
DART,611,Interdisciplinary Practices in Design,"Prerequisites: DART 600 and DART 601.
 This seminar examines the question of how knowledge is produced and transferred through interdisciplinary design and scholarly practices. Topics include socio-cultural, environmental and economic sustainability, participatory design, collaborative methods, communities of practice, epistemic cultures, embodiment, and knowledge production. Readings will be drawn from a broad range of disciplines."
DART,620,Graduate Colloquium,"Prerequisites: DART 610 and DART 611.
 The Graduate Colloquium will foster a community of practice and research by exposing the students to a diversity of work and methods and developing understanding of disciplinary commonalities and differences. Through this colloquium series, presentations by students will be augmented with presentations by faculty, visiting researchers, and practicing designers."
DART,630,Special Topics in Sustainability," Topics may address a range of critical perspectives related to sustainability in terms of the environmental triad of ecological, socio-cultural and economic foci. Sustainable practice can refer to specific technical or scientific fields but also has a broader connotation towards integrative and enduring practices."
DART,631,Special Topics in Visual Communication," Topics may address a range of critical perspectives related to the use of signs, icons, and visual symbols to convey ideas and communicate information. This includes graphic design, typography, illustration, and photography, as well as applications in information design, wayfinding, advertising, packaging, and electronic media."
DART,632,Special Topics in the Built Environment," Topics may address a range of critical perspectives related to the structures, landscapes and spaces, both physical and virtual, in relation to the actions and activities that take place in them over time. This can include large-scale city planning, the design and conceptualization of living and workspaces, and the scale of object that are embedded in those spaces."
DART,633,Special Topics in Interaction Design," Topics may address a range of critical perspectives related to the behaviour of an object or system in relation to its users or participants. Interaction design refers to design practices that embed electronics and computing capabilities into objects, materials, and devices, and it also describes the ways in which systems and processes produce form and structure over time."
DART,634 ,Topics in Contemporary Indigenous Art and Design (3 credits)," Topics may address a range of critical perspectives on contemporary Indigenous art and design in terms of the aesthetic, political, and cultural issues such work illuminates. The course focuses on digital media but may encompass other forms of Indigenous creative practice, including visual arts, performance, and writing."
DART,635 ,"Topics in Design Research (3 credits)
",Topics may address a range of critical perspectives relevant to the evolution of design research.
DART,651,"Directed Study I (3 credits)
",Prerequisites: Nine credits completed in the Master of Design program; written permission of any faculty member of the Thesis Advisory Committee and the Graduate Program Director; a cumulative GPA of 3.70 or higher. Students may enrol in a directed study under faculty supervision in order to undertake a specialized study of theoretical or research-creation related topics.
DART,652,"Directed Study II (3 credits)
",Prerequisites: DART 651; written permission of any faculty member of the Thesis Advisory Committee and the Graduate Program Director; a cumulative GPA of 3.70 or higher. Students may enrol in a directed study under faculty supervision in order to undertake a specialized study of theoretical or research-creation related topics.
DART,671,Professional Internship I,"Prerequisites: Nine credits completed in the Master of Design program; a cumulative GPA of 3.70 or higher; a clearly defined written agreement between the student intern and the employer; written permission of any faculty member of the Thesis Advisory Committee and the Graduate Program Director. This course provides an opportunity for students to further develop their design research in a design firm, cultural organization or residency. "
DART,672,Professional Internship II,"Prerequisites: DART 671; a cumulative GPA of 3.70 or higher; a clearly defined written agreement between the student intern and the employer; written permission of any faculty member of the Thesis Advisory Committee and the Graduate Program Director. This course provides an opportunity for students to further develop their design research in a design firm, cultural organization or residency."
DART,690,Master’s Research and Thesis,"Prerequisites: DART 610 and DART 611.
 The Master’s Research and Thesis will combine a body of work or practice-led research with a written thesis document of 40-55 pages that contextualizes the practice historically and theoretically and reflects critically on the process and production. A formal oral defense and a final public exhibition of the work or practice-led research are required."
